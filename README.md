# OSM Import Roads and Public Transport Stops Plugin

## Overview
This QGIS plugin facilitates the seamless import and processing of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for city road networks and public transport stops. It is designed to streamline the integration of OSM data with GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) datasets, enabling advanced spatial analysis and routing capabilities for public transport systems.

## Features
- **Road Network Import**: Automatically downloads and processes OSM road data, including highways, bus lanes, and other road types.
- **Public Transport Stops Integration**: Imports public transport stops from OSM and matches them with GTFS stops, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **GTFS Data Processing**: Enhances GTFS stop times and routes with spatial attributes derived from OSM data.
- **Routing Preparation**: Generates optimized layers for routing analysis, including stop positions and road segments.

## Plugin Series
This plugin is the second in a series of four plugins designed to work together for comprehensive public transport analysis:
1. **GTFS Agency Selection** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/skagejj/gtfsagency_selection)): Focuses on selecting and filtering GTFS data for specific agencies.
2. **OSM Import Roads and Public Transport Stops** (This Plugin): Handles the import and integration of OSM road and stop data with GTFS datasets.
3. **OSM PT Routing** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/skagejj/osm_pt_routing)): Provides advanced routing capabilities using the processed OSM and GTFS data.
4. **GTFS Shapes Tracer** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/skagejj/gtfs_shapes_tracer)): Generates GTFS shapes based on spatial data for accurate route visualization.

## Usage
1. **Import Roads and Stops**: Use the plugin to download and process OSM road and stop data for your city.
2. **Enhance GTFS Data**: Match GTFS stops with OSM stops and enrich GTFS datasets with spatial attributes.
3. **Prepare Routing Layers**: Generate layers optimized for routing analysis, including stop positions and road segments.
